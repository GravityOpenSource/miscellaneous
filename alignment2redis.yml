# binning for viz
# coverage and depth will be calcualted based on the bin num and bin length
# e.g. klebsiella pneumonia genome size is 5333942, while covid-19 genome size is about 29000
# if bin_num is 1000, the bin lengh will be 5.3K bp and 29 bp, respectively.
# while the smallest virus is Hepatitis delta virus(RNA virus), whose genome size is about 1700,
# so the bin num of 1000 should be fine.
# each read mapping from start to end will fall into corresponding projected bins and increase by 1  
# do NOT change these during the run, otherwise you will get inconsistent bin num which will cause error
# in the downstream viz 
viz:
  bin_num : 1000

# minimap2 options, DO NOT change unless you exactly know it
minimap2:
  # device and mode
  preset : map-ont
  # only needs the primary hit
  # I think there is a bug of mappy, best_n will report 2 hits including the primary one
  # but it should be not set to 0 even it will return exactly one for sake of bug fix later
  # current solution is to filter the hit is primary or not if there are two hits
  best_n : 1
  # minimium mapq which read will be kept
  min_mapq: 40
